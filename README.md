# myeucode

MyEuCode is a script file generator, into the "Euphoria Programming Language."

MyEuCode uses a C library to generate files.  This library can be linked dynamically, using a dynamic link library (dll), or statically, using an object file (*.o).  The library will need to be recompiled on different systems.  The dll should work on any code that can open a dll.  It will also need a directory with read/write permissions, as it will be executing a script, written in Euphoria.

Requires a "Euphoria" installation in order to work.
